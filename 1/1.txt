The Red Guild is running an IRL security awareness campaign at Ethereum
Argentina.

And if you're reading this, it's because you had the guts to plug in a random
USB device you stumbled upon. You're quite brave we must admit.

Why do this? Because it seems that just a few pay attention to their personal
security in crypto events. It's like somehow they feel they're in a magic
wonderland.

We've seen people:
- Navigating to random URLs from unknown QR codes.
- Leaving unlocked devices unattended and not paying attention to them.
- Using hardware wallets to sign transactions on the mainnet with their Metamask
open and visible to others.
- Copying and pasting private keys for everyone to see.
- Talking about how much money they have and trade in crypto.
- Showing off flashy and expensive clothes to impress others.
- Having work calls in public places discussing sensitive information.
- Connecting to any available WiFi without caution.
- Indiscriminately sharing sensitive information with strangers who appear to be
investors.

WTF.

Take care of yourself, your friends and your belongings. Public events can
attrack some shady individuals.

Don't bring your main crypto wallets. Don't bring (or use) your work devices
without being extremely careful. Don't scan unknown QR codes without
understanding the consequences. Don't leave your belongings unattended. Don't
connect unknown USB devices to your own. Don't use any WiFi. Don't share all
sensitive information with strangers you just met.

Now we need you to spread the word!

Jump to memory[0x03] to learn how.

We're The Red Guild. An autonomous collective of security researchers, educators
and advocates committed to safeguarding web3 applications.

We believe in technologies that can help build more fair, open and transparent
social coordination mechanisms. Such as Ethereum.

Being so young, the legitimacy, credibility and reputation of these technologies
gets hurt every time there's a hack in one of the apps that use them.

So for the Ethereum ecosystem to succeed, we must strive to increase the
resiliency of its application layer.

Not only with thoughtful security research and responsible disclosures, but also
with public articles, talks, videos, workshops, wargames, challenges and
awareness campaigns.

We have a sense of responsibility towards the well-being of those who contribute
to web3's long-term game. We use our curiosity and purpose as the fuel to help
keep them safe.

Our goal? Transforming security research and advocacy into a public good
initiative for the common good.

The Red Guild plays another kind of game. Our work complements the private
profit-driven efforts in the space.

You can contribute with The Red Guild spreading the gospel of security
awareness.

1. If you want to proudly keep it for posterity, feel free to copy the contents
of this drive, you won't probably be able to gather them online anytime soon.
2. Remove it from your device, and either:
  A. Drop it somewhere visible in the conference for somebody else to pick it
  up. Let's see if we can get someone else to experience the same as you!
  B. Find a member of The Red Guild and return it.
  C. If the conference is already over, read ./pendrive-reuse-en.txt.
3. Let's keep this a secret. Don't tell others until the end of the conference!

Composed and recorded by AgustÃ­n Diez between July 27 and 28, 2023, in the city
of Tandil - Argentina, "Coast Guard" invites us on a journey through the waves
of time. This musical piece is a fascinating cross between two worlds: chiptune
and synthwave, taking us on a journey filled with nostalgia and adventure.

Imagine navigating a digital ocean where the deep, spatial sounds of the '80s
merge with playful square wave melodies typical of the video game consoles of
that era. It's as if you were in a video game, but with a retro touch that
evokes memories from the past that still resonate in our hearts.

What makes it even more special is its authenticity. No virtual instruments
(VST) were used in its creation. Every note and sound comes from real
synthesizers, played with passion:

Dave Smith Mopho Keyboard: With its rich and enveloping tones, it is the melodic
heart of the piece. Dave Smith Evolver Keyboard: It adds textures and layers
that enrich the melodies. Sequential Prophet Rev 2: With its polyphonic
character in oscillations and modulations, it embraces us and takes us on a
journey through space-time. Moog Matriarch: Its presence is unmistakable,
providing depth and character to the bass. Roland TR9: Responsible for the
pulsating rhythm that keeps us moving. Roland JV1010: Rounds off the
orchestration with its clear and bright tones.

So, get ready to embark on this sonic adventure with Coast Guard! :D

This is an e-zine. And if you already knew that, it probably hit you with nostalgia. It's mainly an ode to the .:: Phrack Magazines ::. [1].

Basically, they are a kind of digital 'magazine', coined mainly by the hacker
community, to communicate their exploits, curiosities, philosophical stances,
and more. Here are a few [2].

This is how The Red Guild pays respect to all those hackers and curious people
who came before us. These little things are a gesture, a humble contribution to
keep whatever is left of that flame alive.

We hope you enjoyed this little nod, and received at least part of the message
;)
